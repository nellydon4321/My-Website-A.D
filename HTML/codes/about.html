        <h2>Hey World!!!!! I'm Adrian DaCosta</h2>
        <p>A proud Jamaican who grew up inna Kingston. If there's one thing you should know about me, it's that mi nuh give up easy. Once mi set mi mind to something, mi push through till it done.</p>
        <p>Born in September, I can be a bit moody at times, but that just means I feel things deeply. If you approach me with respect and kindness, I’ll always try to help in any way I can. I believe in lifting others up and making a difference where it counts.</p>
        <p>I'm a natural problem-solver and leader, always ready to take charge when needed. Whether it’s academics, projects, or personal challenges, I stay focused and push through. I value hard work, integrity, and persistence—qualities that define who I am. But at the same time, I get bored easily, so I like to keep things interesting.</p>
        <p>I’m down-to-earth, a mix of extrovert and introvert, depending on my mood… and my hunger! Because trust me, I love my food—but not just from anyone. It has to be made with love.</p>
        <p>Nuff respect and thanks for passing through!</p>
