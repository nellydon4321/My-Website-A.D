        <h2>Reflection on My Personality</h2>
        <p>After reviewing my personality test results, I find that some traits, like determination and leadership, align well with how I see myself. These qualities help me stay focused in my studies and overcome challenges.</p>
    
        <p>However, I was surprised by some results, such as [mention any unexpected trait]. While personality tests provide useful insights, I believe they don't fully define who we are since personality can change over time.</p>
    
        <p>My personality test results revealed some interesting insights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>âœ… <strong>Strengths:</strong> Determination, leadership, and resilience match how I see myself.</li>
            <li>ðŸ¤” <strong>Surprise:</strong> I didnâ€™t expect [unexpected trait] to be so high/low.</li>
            <li>ðŸ’¡ <strong>Reflection:</strong> While these tests provide insights, they canâ€™t fully define a person.</li>

        <h2>Inspirational Figure: Marcus Garvey</h2>
        <blockquote>
            "If you have no confidence in self, you are twice defeated in the race of life." â€“ Marcus Garvey
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Marcus Garvey inspires me with his persistent belief in self-determination and progress. His mentality inspires me to continue pushing forward in both academics and personal development, regardless of the challenges.
