        <h3>Summary & Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            I have read Chapters 4â€“7 of <em>Twelve Pillars</em> by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener (pp. 43â€“80) and have summarized, reflected, and explained how I can apply the lessons learned to my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            These chapters emphasize the importance of personal growth, discipline, and surrounding oneself with positive influences. The book highlights key principles such as consistent learning, setting goals, and taking responsibility for one's success. A major takeaway for me is the idea that success is built daily through small, intentional actions.
        </p>

        <h3>Application to My Life</h3>
        <p>
            These lessons resonate with me because I realize that progress in my academic and personal life depends on my ability to apply discipline and stay committed to self-improvement. By focusing on lifelong learning and personal responsibility, I can achieve my goals in Computer Science and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
            I plan to implement these principles by setting clear academic and career goals, maintaining a disciplined approach to my studies, and seeking mentorship from experienced professionals. Additionally, I will work on improving my problem-solving skills and time management to ensure steady progress.
        </p>
